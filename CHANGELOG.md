# Changelog

[简体中文](CHANGELOG.zh-CN.md)

The five most recent published versions are listed below.

## 1.0.43 — 2026-09-01

- Upgraded the bundled official DSH runtime and its launch peers to `0.1.2-alpha.3`.
- Updated the bundled ecosystem to Codex UI 0.2.97, IM Connect 0.1.30, Archive Manager 0.1.22, and MCP Connector 0.2.32.
- Hardened offline runtime initialization by sharing the bundled-plugin verifier across Windows smoke tests, waiting for the desktop ready marker on both HTTP paths, and cleaning the full extraction process tree when initialization is cancelled or times out.

Release tag: [`v1.0.43`](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop/tree/v1.0.43).

## 1.0.41 — 2026-08-31

- Fixed the offline bundle so it includes every peer required to launch the official DSH runtime without network access.
- Moved portable first-run verification, extraction, and bulk file copying into a separate child process with staged progress, preventing the window from becoming unresponsive during initialization.
- Bound runtime and plugin-store completion markers to the bundled archive SHA256. Empty or stale markers from overwritten or reused portable directories now trigger re-extraction, so offline first launch no longer starts without plugins.
- Made Windows, macOS, and Linux packaged-app smoke tests force offline mode and verify all ten bundled plugins and their pinned versions in an isolated profile.

Release tag: [`v1.0.41`](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop/tree/v1.0.41).

## 1.0.40 — 2026-08-31

- Upgraded the bundled official DSH runtime and its launch peers to `0.1.2-alpha.2`, including authenticated startup-token handling and the alpha.2 native-script requirements.
- Updated the bundled ecosystem to IM Connect 0.1.27, Skills Manager 0.1.32, Archive Manager 0.1.21, Agency Agents 0.1.23, `dsh-context` 0.38.5, DSH Better Sidebar 0.18.0-alpha.0, MCP Connector 0.2.31, and `dshmarket` 1.38.1.
- Upgraded `electron-builder` to 26.15.7 and refreshed the offline runtime and plugin-store assembly for fresh installs and missing-package repair.
- Aligned Windows, macOS, and Linux packaged-app smoke tests with alpha.2 authentication by verifying the expected unauthenticated response, process liveness, startup diagnostics, and the post-window ready marker in isolated profiles.

Release tag: [`v1.0.40`](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop/tree/v1.0.40).

## 1.0.39 — 2026-08-30

- Added native Linux ARM64 / aarch64 packages for Ubuntu, Debian, and other compatible distributions, with both `.deb` and `.AppImage` artifacts.
- Added a native GitHub-hosted ARM64 packaging job and packaged-app smoke test instead of relying on unverified cross-compilation.
- Added the verified Node.js 24.20.0 Linux ARM64 executable checksum and a release guard for the architecture-specific `latest-linux-arm64.yml` update metadata.
- Updated the English and Chinese download, system-requirement, and development documentation for Linux x64 / ARM64 parity.

Release tag: [`v1.0.39`](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop/tree/v1.0.39).

## 1.0.38 — 2026-08-30

- Updated the six bundled MichengAI products to Codex UI 0.2.94, IM Connect 0.1.26, Automation 0.1.22, Skills Manager 0.1.31, Archive Manager 0.1.19, and Agency Agents 0.1.22.
- Updated the bundled ecosystem components to `dsh-context` 0.38.3, DSH Better Sidebar 0.17.1, MCP Connector 0.2.29, and `dshmarket` 1.38.0.
- Refreshed the offline plugin catalog used by fresh installs and missing-package repair. Existing profiles can apply the same versions through the plugin market without the desktop silently overriding user-selected package versions.
- Kept the bundled official DSH runtime on the current npm release, 0.1.1-rc.2; the source-only 0.1.2 Alpha remains outside the stable desktop channel.

Release tag: [`v1.0.38`](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop/tree/v1.0.38).
